At that point you might as well just link to the anchor link – Ryan Feb 7 '14 at 22:32 5 very cool, but changes my url :-( – chris Feb 18 '14 at 16:46 32 Note that this will only work once. Once the hash is set, the page won't scroll to the same hash unless you change it to a dummy one then set it again. – Cristian Vrabie Nov 10 '14 at 17:05 7 You should not use scrollTo, because it is already used by the global window object. Also the parameter should not be named hash, because location.hash is defined, too. You may use this code: function scrollToHash(hashName) { location.hash = "#" + hashName; } – Markus Zeller Feb 2 '16 at 10:32 2 @MarkusZeller, why shouldn't the parameter be called hash? It doesn't collide with location, does it? – Gherman Dec 5 '16 at 12:46 64 That doesn't actually scroll though, it just jumps.
